Hi there and welcome to my Profile! 😎

Nico Schultze - Software Developer
------------------

My name is Nico, and I am currently deep diving into Software Engineering. It is currently still difficult for me to pin down my exact area of interest, since I am meddling in a lot of them - but here are a few of them: 
- Data Science and Data Engineering
- Web-Based Development
- Game-Development

There are other fields I am highly interested in, but there is only so much time in a day 😄

I have finished my Bachelor in Computer Science and Business with a GPA of 4.0 in the year 2022 and started my Master in Applied Computer Science right after. 
I studied last year in Tokyo for a one-year exchange and got to grow not just academically but also as a Person! An accomplishment I take great pride in is that I managed to pass the second-highest Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT), completely by self study! :mount_fuji:

Furthermore, my Job Experience is with the Mercedes-Benz Group, where I worked in the development process of the new electrical S-Class for Mercedes. 🚗 
It was generally about leveraging an acoustic AI in the production of specific components of that car! I worked with CNNs and also got a deep look at a use case of AI within one of the most successful car companies in Germany! 

Also, the concrete projects I am working on right now are: 
1. Creating a facial recognition security system which runs on a Raspberry Pi, that is equipped with a camera to observe the entrance area of the house of my parents. I might add a web interface with Flask/Django. Tech stack will consist of Python, PyTorch, Git etc.
2. Browser-Based Multiplayer Game with JS, Node, Express and PostgreSQL.
3. Full Data Pipeline Project. Collect, process, analyse and visualize data. Possible tech stack is PySpark, SQL, Docker, Git, Tableau. You can contact me in German, English and Japanese if you have any questions.
